# Redwood Burl Protection Toolkit

A collaborative hub for redwood burl conservation efforts, incident tracking, and advocacy. This repository serves as a centralized, version-controlled platform for volunteers, researchers, and conservationists to coordinate efforts in protecting redwood trees and their burls from illegal poaching and other threats.

## How to Use This Toolkit

This toolkit is designed to streamline conservation workflows through GitHub's issue tracking, labeling, and pull request systems. The intended workflow for volunteers and team members is as follows:

1. **Incident Reporting**: Use the Issues tab to report suspicious activities, poaching incidents, or observed damage to redwood burls. Apply appropriate labels (e.g., `incident-report`, `verification-needed`) to categorize the report.

2. **Verification & Triage**: Team members review new issues, add relevant labels, and assign tasks. Verified incidents may be escalated to authorities or used to generate public awareness campaigns.

3. **Legislative Tracking**: The `LEGISLATION.md` file maintains a record of relevant laws, proposed bills, and advocacy milestones. Updates to this file are made via pull requests, linking to related issues.

4. **Public Awareness Materials**: Educational content, press releases, and outreach materials can be stored in the repository (e.g., in a `docs/` folder). Contributions are welcome via pull requests.

5. **Collaborative Development**: All changes to the repository—whether adding new documentation, updating legislation, or modifying workflows—should be proposed through pull requests. This ensures changes are reviewed and tracked.

6. **Labeling System**: Four primary labels help categorize work:
   - `incident-report` (red): For reports of suspicious activity or poaching.
   - `public-awareness` (blue): For tasks related to education and outreach.
   - `legislative-track` (purple): For tracking legal and policy efforts.
   - `verification-needed` (yellow): Flags reports that require further validation.

Start by exploring the existing issues and labels, and refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed contribution guidelines.
